# Minesweeper!

A simple minesweeper implementation. Written with Typescript and React.

Improvements that would be cool to make:

- improve the UX of the process of losing the game; red box on the clicked bomb, disallow further clicking/flagging
- disallow flagging an opened field
- get away from [y, x] notation in favor of IVector2d
